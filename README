== Randypot ==
  Randypot is a Ruby client for Kandypot (the most sweet of the karma services ever)

== Randypot wannabe tour ==

  Configuration is a good start. We can do it this way:

    Randypot.configure do |config|
      config.service_url = "http://kandypot.com/api"
      config.api_key     = "putyourapikeyhere"
      config.api_token   = "andhereputthetoken"
    end

  Then we can make calls like this to the service:

    Randypot.creation.photo(
      :ugc    => true,
      :member => 'wadus@example.com',
      :permalink => 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'
    )

  But also we can get an instance for a member:

    randy = Randypot.new(
      :ugc    => false, 
      :member => 'randy@example.com')
  
  And then say the same like this:

    randy.creates.photo 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'

  Finally we can make the configuration thing and the member instance in the same step:

    randy = Randypot.new('randy@example.com') do |config|
      config.service_url = "http://kandypot.com/api"
      config.api_key     = "putyourapikeyhere"
      config.api_token   = "andhereputthetoken"
    end

  And then start playing with randy's pot :)

== Comming soon: reactions ==

    #  - if :creator key is not present then content_source will be "editorial"
    randy.reaction.favourite(:permalink => 'http://example.com/sitepage')
    #  - otherwise content_source will be "ugc"
    randy.reaction.comment(
      :creator   => 'wadus@example.com',
      :permalink => 'http://example.com/waduspage')
