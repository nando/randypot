== Randypot ==
  Randypot is a Ruby client for Kandypot (the sweetest karma service ever deployed)

== Randypot wannabe tour ==

  Configuration is a good way to start the tour. It can be set in a YAML with a content like this:
  
    kandypot_server:
      service_url: http://kandypot.com/api
      app_key: putyourappkeyhere
      app_token: andhereputthetoken

  Randypot will look for this YAML in all of this files:
    1.- /etc/randypot/configuration.yml,
    2.- ~/.randypot/configuration.yml (will override any setting loaded by /etc/randypot YAML),
    3.- randypot.yml (in the current directory, will override any setting loaded by previous YAMLs).

  Also we can pass to Randypot the location of the configuration file the doing something like this:

    Randypot.configure '/my/special/place.yml'

  This will override any setting of the automagically loaded YAMLs.

  If we don't want to have it in a YAML we can also do the same with:

    Randypot.configure do |config|
      config.service_url = "http://kandypot.com/api"
      config.app_key     = "putyourappkeyhere"
      config.app_token   = "andhereputthetoken"
    end

  Again, this settings will be used spite of setting loaded from any YAML file.

  Once the configuration is set we can make calls like this to the service (option one):

    Randypot.creation.photo.ugc(
      :member => 'wadus@example.com',
      :permalink => 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'
    )

  But also we can get an instance for a member (option two):

    randy = Randypot.new(:ugc => true, :member => 'randy@example.com')
  
  To do just the same but like this:

    randy.creates.photo 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'

  Or we can create an instance of 'randy' passing only his email (option three):

    randy = Randypot.new('randy@example.com')

  And again do just the same with this even more fancy syntax:

    randy.creates.photo.ugc 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'

== Comming soon: reactions ==

    #  - if :creator key is not present then content_source will be "editorial"
    randy.reacts.favourite(:permalink => 'http://example.com/sitepage')
    #  - otherwise content_source will be "ugc"
    randy.reacts.comment(
      :creator   => 'wadus@example.com',
      :permalink => 'http://example.com/waduspage')
