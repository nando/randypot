== Randypot ==
  Randypot is a Ruby client for Kandypot (the sweetest karma service ever deployed)

== Randypot wannabe tour ==

  Configuration is a good way to start the tour. It can be set in a YAML with a content like this:
  
    kandypot_server:
      service_url: http://kandypot.com/api
      app_key: putyourappkeyhere
      app_token: andhereputthetoken

  Randypot will look for this YAML in all of this files:
    1.- /etc/randypot/configuration.yml,
    2.- ~/.randypot/configuration.yml (will override any setting loaded by /etc/randypot YAML),
    3.- randypot.yml (in the current directory, will override any setting loaded by previous YAMLs).

  Also we can pass to Randypot the location of the configuration file the doing something like this:

    Randypot.configure '/my/special/place.yml'

  This will override any setting of the automagically loaded YAMLs.

  If we don't want to have it in a YAML we can also do the same with:

    Randypot.configure do |config|
      config.service_url = "http://kandypot.com/api"
      config.app_key     = "putyourappkeyhere"
      config.app_token   = "andhereputthetoken"
    end

  Again, this settings will be used spite of setting loaded from any YAML file.

  Once the configuration is set we can make calls like this to the service:

    Randypot.creation.photo(
      :ugc    => true,
      :member => 'wadus@example.com',
      :permalink => 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'
    )

  But also we can get an instance for a member:

    randy = Randypot.new(
      :ugc    => false, 
      :member => 'randy@example.com')
  
  And then say the same like this:

    randy.creates.photo 'http://example.com/wadus.jpg'

  Finally we can make the configuration thing and the member instance in the same step:

    randy = Randypot.new('randy@example.com') do |config|
      config.service_url = "http://kandypot.com/api"
      config.app_key     = "putyourappkeyhere"
      config.app_token   = "andhereputthetoken"
    end

  And then start playing with randy's pot :)
